  experience in private residential development but we take on larger projects
  too. 


  We work across London and the surrounding area across a range from internal
  renovations, home extensions, commercial conversions and new build houses.
  Format was founded in 2012 by father and son team Robert and James O’Hara.
  Between them they have over 45 years architectural experience.
