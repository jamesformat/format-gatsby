  Complete renovation of a derelict former coach house. The site was tucked
  behind a row of terraced houses with a narrow driveway to the road and had
  been abandoned for years. Format was engaged by Knight James Developments to
  acquire planning permission for a set of extensions to the front of the
  building and then undertake the technical design to convert into a three
  bedroom house with large open plan ground floor and basement office-cum-cinema
  room.
