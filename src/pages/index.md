title: Format Extend
landingPageText: "Format is a small architect’s practice based in North-West London. Our primary experience is in private residential development, but we take on larger projects too. \n\nWe work across London and the surrounding area across a range from internal renovations, home extensions, commercial conversions and new build houses. Format was founded in 2012 by father and son team Robert and James O’Hara. Between them they have over 45 years architectural experience. \n\nPlease call us on 020 7625 5007 or email <mailto:info@formatextend.com> to arrange a meeting and discuss your project.\n\n_\"We have done 3 major renovations and this one was by far the most complicated but in the end, the least stressful.  Everything was taken care of such that we didn't have to worry about dealing with anything ourselves.  I would highly recommend anyone considering a project to work with Format Extend.\"_\n\n_\"James' calm manor and creative ideas meant we felt like it was a process rather than just an 'architect's idea' in our house.\r His pride and joy in seeing the finished work was also apparent.\"_"
