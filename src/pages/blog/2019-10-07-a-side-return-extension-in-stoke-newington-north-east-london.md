description: >-
  A side return extension for a young family in Stoke Newington, North East
  London. Format carried out all the initial design, planning application,
  technical design, contractor tender and contract administration.


  The design included renovations to a basement bedroom with en-suite shower
  room; the bedroom opens onto a light-well between the house and the extension.
  The large windows provide a visual connection between the different spaces and
  levels of the split level ground floor, basement, dining area and the garden.
