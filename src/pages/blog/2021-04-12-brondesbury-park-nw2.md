description: >-
  This new build, 2 storey house has been designed as an extension to an
  existing garage which occupied the bottom of the client's garden. Format
  administered a series of planning applications and appeals to achieve,
  planning permission and have now taken the project through to construction,
  due to be completed later this year.


  The design features a sunken ground floor which allows sufficient space for 2
  bedroom in the roof space, both with an average head height of at least 2.3m
  despite the canted ceilings. The eaves space is utilised as storage at the
  front of the house and to provide roof-lights to the rear of the ground floor,
  where the house sits up against the boundary with the neighbouring garden
  behind.
