At the end of September, [‘#DesignTookLondon’ during London Design Festival 2015](http://www.londondesignfestival.com/). It was Queens Park’s second year as a designated Design District and for the first time [Format](http://formatextend.com/) and [ROH Architects](http://www.roh-architects.com/) were getting stuck in.

Some in the office had seen what [Queens Park Design District](http://queensparkdesigndistrict.co.uk/) (QPDD) had done the year before – with a street party and many of our talented neighbours throwing their doors open… And we wanted in.

People were free to do their own thing but the 2 main events of the district’s calendar were a Thursday evening ‘late studios’ and a more family friendly Sunday open day.

So what did we do and what did we learn?

Our exhibition centred on a simple scheme featuring a block of ‘traditional’ London Victorian houses. We thought about how it might be developed as a whole to create something new that maximised the usage of the available space, retained the familiar street frontage and at the same time created something completely different at the rear. Whilst there are certainly styles of property that have fared much worse over the years and would have warranted this kind of attention, we chose the Victorian terrace as it is a style of house that most people who came through the door would be familiar with.

We had 5 key points that we wanted to communicate through our scheme:

1. **Densification** - the UK isn’t that big and we have to preserve as much of our countryside as possible so that means just one thing – make the cities denser – it’s also more energy efficient! Our scheme showcased high-quality, increased density of residential accommodation.
2. **Re-thinking common or conservative views of building extensions** - just because a certain type of building is traditionally extended or renovated in a certain way, doesn’t mean it can or should only be done that way. Because our scheme was able to look at the development of a whole block many of the amenity issues presented by piecemeal extensions were prevented, making it possible to get more from each site.
3. **Roof Gardens** - where they are permitted they proliferate, ‘everyone’ wants them, yet they are blocked by most local authorities in London on overly exaggerated grounds of privacy and disruption.  If done well they make for an amazing roof top landscape, they provide much needed external amenity space for upper floor flats and there is just something great about sitting outside at roof level. We should take a leaf out of other world cities books and go roof garden mad!
4. **Utilise ground level external amenity space (gardens) efficiently** – we wanted to think about whether we all use what we have efficiently, as well as some options for that space. We suggest that, on average, smaller private gardens are more likely to be used efficiently (we’re waiting on the lab to come back on this…). Small gardens are more manageable and still leave space for that al-fresco summer meal. The left-over space can be donated for communal gardens, common in parts of London, giving kids more space to run and play, people can take walks or relax by a pond of a size that would otherwise be unfeasible in most back-gardens.  These spaces can still be gated, solely for the use of residents, ensuring security. Alternatively, if people don’t like sharing, how about simply re-instating access alleyways?  Again, modern security can make the use of these safe and the ability to carry shopping/garden equipment/muddy boots directly to the rear of the house without traipsing through it has benefits. We think we’ve only just scratched the surface of this – please feel free to let us know your thoughts.

5. **Re-use of existing building fabric** – not pulling down and starting again – reclaimed materials are all the rage these days so why not make the ultimate reclamation and use an entire existing building!

None of these things are particularly new or revolutionary concepts but all rolled up into one scheme they were a good starting point to show the public what Format is all about… and I think we can mark both the Late Studios and Family Day as a success.

Outside our doors the rest of QPDD were not holding back either, with a party going on inside or out-front of almost every studio on the road – it would take too long to list all the most excellent exhibitors and exhibits so check them out [on the website here](http://queensparkdesigndistrict.co.uk/partners.php). On Thursday night as we shut up shop (already much later than planned) and headed into town for a wee night-cap courtesy of Dezeen, Wing.TV’s Cinema-cum-disco opposite us was still going full pelt.

We’re very pleased with how everything went and it was a great stepping stone, but next year we’ll do it bigger and better, there is always room for improvement. I think all in the office have had a taste and would like some more!

A big thank you to everyone who came down and to all the people who put work into QPDD this year. Keep your eyes peeled for info about next year’s event, we’d love to see you down here!
