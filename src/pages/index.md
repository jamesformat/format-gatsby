landingPageText: >-
  Format is a small architectural practice based in North-West London. Our
  primary experience is in private residential development, but we take on
  larger projects too. We have worked across London and the surrounding area
  since 2012 and undertake all work stages from concept and planning, to
  technical design and contract administration. 


  Please call us on 020 7625 5007 or email [info@formatextend.com](mailto:info@formatextend.com) to arrange a meeting and discuss your project.


  *"Everything was taken care of such that we didn't have to worry about dealing with anything ourselves.  I would highly recommend anyone considering a project to work with Format Extend." - MS, Stoke Newington*


  *"James' calm manner and creative ideas meant we felt like it was a process rather than just an 'architect's idea' in our house.
   His pride and joy in seeing the finished work was also apparent." - NM, Crouch End*
