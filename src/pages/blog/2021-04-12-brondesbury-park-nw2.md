description: >-
  This new build, 2 storey house has been designed as an extension of an
  existing garage which occupied the bottom of the client's garden.  The
  garage's form has been extrapolated and a low single storey front projection
  added. Format administered a series of planning applications and appeals to
  achieve, planning permission and have now taken the project through to
  construction, due to be completed later this year.


  The design features a sunken ground floor which allows sufficient space for 2
  bedroom in the roof space, both with an average head height of at least 2.3m
  despite the canted ceilings. The eaves space is utilised as storage at the
  front of the house and to provide roof-lights to the rear of the ground floor,
  where the house sits up against the boundary with the neighbouring garden
  behind.
