When our clients came to us the flat was in need of some serious work: the inside felt like a hobbit hole and the garden like Mirkwood. Luckily Knight James had a strong vision and together we created a total re-design, including 2 rear extensions that utilised the siteâ€™s shape and existing building line to maximise its potential. A complete internal re-arrangement, bringing as much light as possible into the living spaces and master bedroom completed the design. Some creative landscaping in the garden and the flat was to be transformed.

The planning gods smiled on us that day and the project was soon on-site.

Format then created a working drawings package for the contractors and provided on site consultation throughout the build to ensure that the process of gutting the lower ground floor of a fully occupied building went to plan! 

We think the results speak for themselves!
