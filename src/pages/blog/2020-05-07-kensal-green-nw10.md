description: >-
  A rear extension for a young couple starting a family. We created a snug space
  between the front living room and the back kitchen-diner and by folding the
  wall between the hallway and the snug created additional storage alcoves for
  both spaces without impacting on the perceived space. The single pitched roof
  uses standing seam zinc weathering and has two long slot roof lights to bring
  light into the part of the room where it is needed most. Leaving the exposed
  brick to the new party wall creates a continuity with the outside space.
