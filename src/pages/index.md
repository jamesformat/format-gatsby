  Format is a small architectâ€™s practice based in North-West London. Our primary
  experience is in private residential development, but we take on larger
  projects too. We have worked across London and the surrounding area since 2012
  and undertake all work stages from concept and planning, to technical design
  and contract administration. 


  Please call us on 020 7625 5007 or email <mailto:info@formatextend.com> to
  arrange a meeting and discuss your project.


  _"We have done 3 major renovations and this one was by far the most
  complicated but in the end, the least stressful.  Everything was taken care of
  such that we didn't have to worry about dealing with anything ourselves.  I
  would highly recommend anyone considering a project to work with Format
  Extend."_


  _"James' calm manor and creative ideas meant we felt like it was a process
  rather than just an 'architect's idea' in our house.
   His pride and joy in seeing the finished work was also apparent."_
