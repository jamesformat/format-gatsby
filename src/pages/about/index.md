Format is a small architect’s practice based in North-West London specialising in private residential development but we take on larger projects too. We work across London and the surrounding area across a range from internal renovations, extensions, commercial conversions and new build houses.

Format was founded in 2012 by father and son team Robert and James O’Hara. Between them they have over 45 years experience in architecture.
